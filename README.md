psych fork originally meant for Sonic.EXE 2.5 before it got scrapped

Adds quant notes, hscript and a shitty Playfield system that I really didnt think too far ahead with
also epics from Andromeda lol


also the base for NightmareVision and originally for Troll Engine (though TE still inherits alot of code from here)
